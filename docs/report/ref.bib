    abstract = "In our study, we aimed at investigating how two years old children make use of the pragmatics in order to learn new words from an ongoing interaction. We operationalized the situational pragmatics making use of the concept of frames as introduced by developmental psychologists. The basic logic was to place 30 children at the age of 27 months in situations, in which they can barely rely on their prior pragmatic knowledge. Instead, they depend on extracting more information from the observed interaction. Our hypothesis was that when learning in unfamiliar frames, children in the indirect teaching condition would take advantage of the demonstrated behavior to identify with one of the communicative partners in order to be able to imitate his/her behavior.",
