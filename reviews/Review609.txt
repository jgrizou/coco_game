Comments to the author
======================

This was an intriguing paper.
I have never read anything like it.
It is difficult to review.
There may be questions over its relevance to the
conference.
The setting tackled in the experiments is one where there
is an extremely limited channel of communication and
absolutely no prior knowledge of meanings. How realistic is
this setting in human-robot interaction?
It was interesting to read that humans solve the problem by
"projecting the interaction into different common frames of
interaction..."
This is a very useful insight for human-robot interaction.
I guess the paper would feel more complete to me if it
could give an outline of how the same mechanism could be
implemented in a robot. This is just mentioned in the
conclusion.

Overall I would say it is an intriguing study from the
human-human interaction point of view, but the robot-human
interaction perspective is really only touched on at the
end.

Some of the writing is not English, e.g. frequent "allows
to" or use of as: "similar as".
